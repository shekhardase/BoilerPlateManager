# Boilerplate Manager

Boilerplate Manager is a simple web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to manage and store code snippets or boilerplate templates conveniently.

## How It Works

1. **Adding Boilerplates:** Users can add new boilerplates by entering a name and the corresponding code snippet in the provided input fields and clicking the "Save" button.

2. **Viewing Boilerplates:** All added boilerplates are displayed below the input form. Each boilerplate is presented with its name, code snippet, and options to copy the code or delete the boilerplate.

3. **Copying Boilerplates:** Users can click the "Copy" button to copy the code of a specific boilerplate to their clipboard, making it easy to use the boilerplate elsewhere.

4. **Deleting Boilerplates:** Users can remove any boilerplate from the list by clicking the "Delete" button associated with that boilerplate.
